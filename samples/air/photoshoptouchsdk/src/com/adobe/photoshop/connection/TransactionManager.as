	 *  The TransactionManager is a class that makes it easy to always grab the next transaction ID. It can be used in a singleton pattern. You may manage transaction IDs yourself,
	 *   but the API uses this class, and it will then be up to your application to not create IDs that conflict with the APIs requests. This may become particularly tricky
	 *   if you also use the API's SubscriptionManager. If you send requests with your own transaction IDs and Photoshop responds with those IDs, it's possible you could trigger
	 *   the SubscriptionManager for any active subscriptions, leading to undetermined behavior (probably parsing errors or SubscriptionEvents with confusing data).
