    <h1>Windows Connection How-To</h1>
<p>
   A typical user workflow would be something like this:
 <ol>
 <li>Install Photoshop CS5.</li>
 <li>Enable Remote connections.  Edit &gt; Remote Connectionsâ€¦</li>
<li>In the Remote Connections dialog, set Password and check Enable Remote Connections. Click OK.</li>
<li> Windows will throw a dialog asking if it should allow Photoshop CS5 through the firewall.</li>
<li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<span class="captionText">Windows 7 Dialog shown</span><br />
<br />
If a user clicks No, they have basically just told the OS not to allow<script type="text/javascript">document.write(appString);</script> communication with remote apps.  Even though everything looks OK, <script type="text/javascript">document.write(appString);</script> the OS will block any communication.
</p>

<h2>Steps to Resolve issue</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Windows Start Menu &gt; Control Panel</li>
<li> Go to Firewall Settings in Control Panel</li>
<img alt="Firewall" src="../images/Win7Firewall1.png" width="300"/>
<li> Click on "Allow a program through Windows Firewall".  This option is slightly different for each OS.</li>
<li>If <script type="text/javascript">document.write(appString);</script> is listed in the list of programs simply. Click On check box to allow <script type="text/javascript">document.write(appString);</script> to communicate through Firewall.  User may have to enter admin password to make change.<br />

On Windows 7 they differentiate between Work, Home, Public networks.  User will have to make their own choice there.  I would recommend Work and Home to start.  I do not envision too many people using thier apps in Starbucks but you never know.  Just something to be aware of. </li>
<li>If <script type="text/javascript">document.write(appWithVersion);</script> is *NOT* listed in the list of programs.</li>    
<li>Click "Add Program"</li>
<li>Choose <script type="text/javascript">document.write(appWithVersion);</script> from list of Programs.  May require Admin Password.</li>
<img alt="Firewall" src="../images/Win7Firewall4.png" width="450" />
<li>OK all dialogs.</li>
<li> Restart <script type="text/javascript">document.write(appString);</script> to be safe.</li>
</ol>

<h2>When all else fails</h2>

  If all else fails and you still cannot connect to Photoshop, go back into the Windows Firewall Settings in Control Panel and remove all instances of <script type="text/javascript">document.write(appString);</script>.
  <ol>
  <li>Quit <script type="text/javascript">document.write(appString);</script> if it is running</li>
  <li>Windows Start Menu &gt; Control Panel</li>
  <li>Get back into Firewall setting</li>
  <li>Click on &quot;Allow a program through Windows Firewall&quot;</li>
  <li>You may have to click on the &quot;Change Settings&quot; button</li>
  <li>Find and click on <script type="text/javascript">document.write(appString);</script></li>
  <li>Click on the "Remove" button</li>
  <li>If you see more of them, please remove all of them.</li>
  <li>Launch <script type="text/javascript">document.write(appString);</script></li>
  <li>When Windows pop the Firewall dialog, click "Allow Access"</li>
